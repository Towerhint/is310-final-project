## Information Accessibility for Non-Dominant Languages Users
#### By Zhangheng Chen, 2022

### Abstract

As a bilingual (Mandarin and English), information accessibility for me is great as I can access (either read, listen or interact with) information among web communities. How about people who are in the Philippines (Tagalog), or Tanzania (Swahili)? Their official languages are important to them but may limit them from accessing the vast majority of information. We have a general sense of helping people who are minority in our society to better accessing information to “close the gap”. However, they are many “information minorities” who cannot access the majority of information in the world not because they cannot use the technology, but the unknown language making them as illiterate.

For this project, I will explore how much information they can access, how they access information on the Internet by their native tongue. I will create demo and interactive examples of how the information minorities retrieve information and analyze potential problems that it may cause because of the lack of information. For people who can speak the major languages in the world, the multifaceted view of information would help to better view information.

### Data and Reference

I hope to achieve two goals for this project: understand and present the difficulties of accessing information for non-dominant language users and provides potential solution for the information minorities to better access information.

-	To explore the difficulties of people accessing information, I will read some articles about this topic. It may be a little difficult because I am looking for experience of people who do not know Chinese and English. But I am positive that there are people who later learn a dominant language can share their experience.
-	To better present/demonstrate/visualize the burden of people accessing information, I will need to learn about how to make an interactive website. (Reference: Puddings) Thus, I will need to learn about some web development to support my idea. 
-	To provide possible solutions for people to access information, I plan to make a tool that would help them to understand the information they can possibly access. 
o	Here is the key: Google, Bing and other search engines have done a great job for querying information for people in ANY language. However, many people do not know how to manipulate the search methods and cause them to be trapped in an echo chamber that only allow them to interact with information presented in the native language. However, what if we can tag, mark or decorate information for them to know, understand and interact in some fashion? It will unlock a world that is so much bigger for them. They do not need to learn the dominant language, but they should know how much information there is in the world.

-	Continue with study of TOP

April 4 – April 17
-	To make three demos in presenting the difficulties of accessing data
-	Continue with the study of TOP

April 18 – May 1
